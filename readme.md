# 51st VFW Mission Editing

This repository provides mission editing and creation SOPs for the wing along with an index of
missions and templates available through 51st VFW repositories.

## SOPs & Tips

There are a range of SOPs and tips available to help mission designers out,

- [Mission SOPs](./documentation/me_sops.md)
  discuses 51st VFW SOPs and best practices for mission creation and construction.
- [Mission Workflow](./documentation/me_workflow.md)
  presents the 51st VFW mission design workflow to help build missions that follow the 51st
  VFW SOPs.
- [Mission Editing Compendium](./documentation/me_guide.md)
  provides a wealth of useful scripting material including documentation, frameworks, and
  reference scripts.
- [51st VFW MapSOP Script](./51stMapSOP/readme.md)
  is a Lua script that supports common setup tasks (carriers, tankers, AWACS, communications,
  etc.) consistent with 51st VFW SOP.

The templates and missions (links below) are also good sources of information.

## Missions & Templates

There are several 51st VFW repositories that contain a variety of mission templates and full
missions,

- [Public 51st VFW Mission Templates](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/MissionEditing-Templates)
  provides starting points for mission design based on 51st VFW SOPs. This repository is public.
- [Private 51st VFW Mission Templates](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/template-missions)
  provides starting points for mission design, not all are consistent with the 51st VFW SOPs.
  This repository is private to the wing.
- [Missions](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/missions)
  provides a repository for select 51st VFW missions. This repository is private to the wing.
- [MOOSE Super Carrier 101](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/supercarrier_cat_training) provides a
  basic template for MOOSE and supercarrier.

This material is helpful not only as starting points for mission designers but also as tools to
learn about scripting and so on.
